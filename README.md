# Hi, I'm Mark ðŸ‘‹

Maker of things. Breaker of other things. Occasional fixer of the things I break.

## What I Do

I tinker with whatever catches my interest:

- Web experiments that occasionally work
- 3D printing objects of questionable utility
- Obscure applications of computer vision
- Making tutorials when I accidentally learn something

## Tech I Use

```
Some web stuff (I like js frameworks)
Just barely enough Python/Rust to be dangerous
Whatever helps make the computer do the thing
```

## Find Me

- Sometimes coherent at [markury.dev](https://markury.dev)
- Email if you must: hello@markury.dev
